<p class="text-component">How does your performance review process compare?</p>
<p class="text-component">The number one goal was to facilitate personal and professional growth of employees, followed by the goal of boosting business performance. Thus, HR leaders know that the performance review can and should simultaneously support the growth and development of individual employees while driving positive results for the business as a whole. 
</p>
<p class="text-component">How would you rate the effectiveness of your performance review process in achieving the goal(s) above?</p>
<p class="text-component">Balancing and accomplishing those goals is no easy task— only about 64% of HR leaders reported that their performance review process is effective at achieving its goals.

<p class="text-component">Uncovering Experience Gaps</p>
<p class="text-component">In order to get a deeper understanding of how all employees are impacted by the performance review process, we surveyed three groups: HR leaders, managers, and individual contributors. We asked questions not just about how each group felt about the performance review process, but also about how they thought the other groups felt.

The results revealed that there are indeed significant discrepancies in the reported experiences that each group has with the performance review process. 

Explore these gaps below.

<p class="text-component">Closing the Gaps — Designing a Review Process That Benefits Everyone
</p>
<p class="text-component">In the last few years, the workplace has been totally reimagined — so it only makes sense that there would be an increasingly pressing need to reimagine how we think about and conduct performance reviews. In reimagining a review process, HR leaders should focus on closing the gaps discussed in this report and designing a process that is beneficial, fair, and impactful to all involved. 

But we know that’s much easier said than done — so we designed a comprehensive guide to designing a fair, valuable, efficient review process. 

We’ve distilled conversations with strategic HR leaders, a recent survey of over 1,000 strategic HR leaders, and a thorough review of academic and industry research into 5 principles to keep in mind as you are designing your review process. Also, every organization has different goals and context to consider when designing reviews. We’ll walk through decisions, options, and tradeoffs you will encounter as you design your review process, and share best practices.
